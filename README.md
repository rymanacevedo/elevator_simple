# Simple Elevator in JavaScript

This project contains a simple elevator simulator written in JavaScript.

## Some Assumptions:
1. The time to open and close the doors, or time to exit or enter isn't taken into account.
2. The elevator travels from one floor to another without interuption.

## Running the Code:

### Option 1: Using a Browser's Developer Console
1. Open your browser and navigate to the developer console (e.g., in Chrome, you can press `F12`).
2. Copy and paste the JavaScript code into the console.
3. Press `Enter` to run the code.
4. A prompt will appear asking for the list of floors. Provide the required input and press `Enter`.
5. Observe the results in the console.

## Input Format:
Enter the starting floor and the floors to visit, separated by commas. For example: `12,2,9,1,32`.

## Output:
The program will display the total travel time in seconds and the order in which the floors were visited.
